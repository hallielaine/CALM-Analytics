CALM-Analytics
==============
CALM Analytics is a software suite for Android Application Developers. We let you track information about your Application's user base. CALM Analytics provides
a general set of data that is automatically collected for every session in your application. In addition, you can customize the data that is collected and add
rules to track certain screens and events that happen within your Application. All of this data is managed and stored for you in a Force.com database.
You can view graphs about your data on the CALM Dashboard and look at trends on a daily or monthly basis.
